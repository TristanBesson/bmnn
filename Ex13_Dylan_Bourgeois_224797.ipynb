In this exercise, we will explore a different approach for modelling decision making, the drift-diffusion model. This model is introduced in paragraph 16.4.2 of the book. It is a phenomenological model which is used to describe the decision making process between two mutually exclusive options (see the experiment on motion perception, described in chapter 16.1).\n",

The function should take parameters $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and a boundary $B$ as inputs and return the final choice, its correctness, the reaction time for that trial, and the whole trajectory of the decision variable. Note that the correctness ($x=\\pm B$) of the reaction is dependent on the sign of $\\mu$. \n",

    "3. Simulate your drift-diffusion model for 10000 trials with $\\mu=0.001, \\sigma=0.05, B=1$ and plot the reaction time distribution. Separate correct and wrong decisions. Understand and briefly describe the provided function plot_rt_distribution. Use it to plot the reaction time histogram. \n",
    "4. Now simulate your model with different initial values $x_0\\neq0$ for your decision variable. To do so, write a new function by modifying your function of Question 1 by adding the new parameter $x_0$ to it. Plot the decision variable trajectories and the reaction time histogram (i.e repeat the plots of Questions 2 and 3) for different combinations of $x_0\\in (-B,B)$ and $\\mu$. Discuss your results."
